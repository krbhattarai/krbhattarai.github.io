  abstract = "We investigate how corporate culture relates to firm performance, focusing specifically on
   market share growth following an increase in competition in the product market. Using industry-level 
   import tariff cuts in the United States as an exogenous shock, we find that firms with 
   strong cultures tend to experience higher market share growth after a reduction in import tariffs. 
   We also identify two distinct cultural values – the strong-people focus and the strong-technology focus – 
   and find that only firms with a strong-people focus are likely to experience market share growth when faced 
   with intensified competition. In addition, firms with a strong corporate culture demonstrate enhanced 
   operating performance after tariff cuts, and this cultural strength contributes to an improvement in firm value.
    Our study provides new insights into how corporate culture can, as an intangible asset, help companies adapt
     to unexpected events.",

  title  = "The Relationship Between Non-Debt and Debt-Tax Shield: An Evidence from the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act ",
  author = "Bhattarai, Keshav and Petrie Fuller, Kathleen",
  year   = 2024,
  abstract = "We use the setting provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 to re-examine the relation 
  between non-debt tax shield (NDTS) and firms’ debt financing decisions. The TCJA brought significant changes to 
  the corporate tax system, including reduced corporate tax rates and limited interest deductions and capital expensing, 
  which reduced the tax benefits of debt. We hypothesize that firms with low marginal benefits of debt, especially 
  those impacted by the interest deductibility limitation, will demonstrate a higher substitution effect between 
  non-debt tax shields (NDTS) and debt financing. Employing a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), we find that 
  affected firms significantly reduce their reliance on debt financing when there is an increase in depreciation 
  deduction, a proxy for NDTS. Furthermore, this effect is more pronounced for firms with lower effective tax rates.
   Our study contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive understanding of the interplay 
   between NDTS and debt financing.",
