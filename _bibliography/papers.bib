  abstract = "We investigate how corporate culture relates to firm performance, focusing specifically on
   market share growth following an increase in competition in the product market. Using industry-level 
   import tariff cuts in the United States as an exogenous shock, we find that firms with 
   strong cultures tend to experience higher market share growth after a reduction in import tariffs. 
   We also identify two distinct cultural values – the strong-people focus and the strong-technology focus – 
   and find that only firms with a strong-people focus are likely to experience market share growth when faced 
   with intensified competition. In addition, firms with a strong corporate culture demonstrate enhanced 
   operating performance after tariff cuts, and this cultural strength contributes to an improvement in firm value.
    Our study provides new insights into how corporate culture can, as an intangible asset, help companies adapt
     to unexpected events.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
