Hello! My name is Keshav Bhattarai, and I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at the University of Mississippi. My research delves into crucial areas such as corporate culture, product market competition, corporate tax, and mergers and acquisitions. My current research explores a variety of topics, including the influence of corporate culture on market outcomes, the dynamics of debt and non-debt tax shields under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and corporate culture and managerial discretion, product market competition, and the intricates of odd-lots trades.

I have presented my work at the Southern Finance Association and am scheduled to present at the Financial Management Association in 2024. Additionally, I also have valuable teaching experience, leading both basic and upper-level finance courses at the University of Mississippi, as well as teaching at NIST College and Kathmandu Barsha College in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Beyond academia, I worked as an accountant at a manufacturing company in Nepal.
You can reach me at <kbhattarai@bus.olemiss.edu>.
