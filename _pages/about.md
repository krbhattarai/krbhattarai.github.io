Hello! My name is Keshav Bhattarai, and I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at the University of Mississippi. My primary research area is in empirical corporate finance.  My current research explores a variety of topics, including the influence of corporate culture on product market outcomes, the dynamics of debt and non-debt tax shields under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and corporate culture and managerial discretion, product market competition, and aggregation of odd-lots trades and market quality. 
I have presented my work at the Southern Finance Association and am scheduled to present at the Financial Management Association in 2024. In addition to research, I have valuable teaching experience, leading both introductory and upper-level finance courses at the University of Mississippi. Prior to pursuing my MBA in the US, I worked as an instructor at NIST College and Kathmandu Barsha College in Kathmandu, Nepal. I also gained professional experience as an accountant for a manufacturing company in Nepal.
Outside of academia, I enjoy spending time with my wife, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, playing tennis and watching soccer.
