My name is Keshav Bhattarai, and I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of Texas Permian Basin. My primary research area is empirical corporate finance. I have presented my work at the Financial Management Association and the Southern Finance Association conferences. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy spending time with my wife, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, playing tennis, and watching soccer.
