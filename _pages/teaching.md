<p>My teaching philosophy is to focus on sparking curiosity in students and know them. I believe that genuine interest in the subject drives engagement and motivation, helping students grasp fundamental concepts and tackle complex ideas more effectively. By knowing my students, I can more effectively address their individual challenges and support their learning journey.  I aim to create an environment where my enthusiasm for the subject is clear, and I encourage students to think critically, relate their education to real-life situations, and develop independent thinking skills.</p>
