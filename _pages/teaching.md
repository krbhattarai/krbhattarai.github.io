<p>My teaching philosophy is simple: curiosity drives learning. I believe that when students are genuinely interested in a subject, they become more engaged, motivated, and better equipped to grasp complex ideas. Moreover, I strive to understand and know my students as individuals. By doing so, I can more effectively address their unique challenges and support them in their learning journey. My goal is to create an environment that encourages students to think critically, connect their education to real-life situations, and develop independent thinking skills.</p>
